Google+ Hangout API State Machine

This code is provided as-is with no warranty, expressed or implied. Use at your own risk. See the LICENSE file for information on the LGPL license.

SUMMARY:
This project was created to fill a gap in the Google+ Hangout API when it comes to managing shared state across multiple clients that my join or drop out of a running app in a hangout. The provided class, kungfuters.StateMachinePlus, attempts to manage local state when updates to the shared state occur.

USAGE:
There are two main thing you'll need to do to use kungfuters.StateMachinePlus:

1) Instantiate the class with a custom setup() method that includes your transition definitions:

	var stateMachine = new kungfuters.StateMachinePlus({
		setup: function() {
			this.addTransition("phase1", "phase2");
			this.addTransition("phase2", "phase3");
		}
	});

2) Call the begin() method with your first phase:

	stateMachien.begin("phase1");

I'll be posting updates about this on Google+, and in case you have questions, just circle me.
